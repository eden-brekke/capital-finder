# Capital Finder
This is a simple demonstration to test out (local)serverless functionality   
You can type in a Capital name as a query in the url and the site will return the country!   
Like-wise you can type in a Country name as a query in the url and the site will return the capital :)   

Example Requests:  

https://capital-finder-ben-carter.vercel.app/api/country?name=lima Returns "lima is the capital of Peru"  

https://capital-finder-ben-carter.vercel.app/api/capital?name=peru Returns "the capital of peru is Lima"  


### Collaborations
I worked with Ben Carter and I referenced his code while I was troubleshooting, so our code looks pretty dang similar :)  
Also got a lot of the base code from lecture with JB
